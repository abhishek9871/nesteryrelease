# PCI DSS Compliance Report for Nestery's Booking.com Integration

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the security measures and PCI DSS compliance strategy implemented for Nestery's Booking.com Demand API integration. Based on comprehensive research and analysis, this report provides actionable recommendations to ensure 100% secure payment handling.

## Current Implementation Analysis

### Security Issues Identified

1. **Raw Card Data Transmission**: The current implementation collects and transmits raw credit card details through Nestery's systems
2. **Insufficient Input Validation**: Limited validation on payment fields
3. **Logging Risks**: Potential for sensitive data to be logged
4. **Missing Security Controls**: Lack of rate limiting, IP whitelisting, and security headers

### PCI DSS Scope Assessment

**Current Scope**: SAQ D (Merchant handling raw card data)
- Requires full network segmentation
- Quarterly vulnerability scans
- Annual penetration testing
- Comprehensive security policies
- QSA assessment required

## Research Findings: Booking.com Requirements

### Payment Processing Model

Based on research of Booking.com's official documentation:

1. **API Approach**: Booking.com Demand API expects raw card details in the payload
2. **No Client-Side Tokenization**: No evidence found of Booking.com providing client-side tokenization SDK
3. **PCI DSS Requirement**: Partners must be PCI DSS compliant when handling card data
4. **Security Responsibility**: Shared responsibility model - Nestery responsible for secure transmission

### Key Findings

- Booking.com does not currently offer a client-side tokenization solution similar to Stripe.js
- Raw card details must be transmitted to Booking.com's API endpoints
- Partners are required to maintain PCI DSS compliance
- HTTPS encryption is mandatory for all API communications

## Implemented Security Controls

### Phase 1: Immediate Security Hardening

#### Backend Security Enhancements

1. **Input Validation**
   - Enhanced card number validation with Luhn algorithm
   - CVV format validation (3-4 digits)
   - Cardholder name sanitization
   - Expiry date format validation

2. **Secure Logging**
   - Masked card numbers in logs (showing only last 4 digits)
   - Removed sensitive data from debug logs
   - Implemented security event logging

3. **PCI Security Middleware**
   - Rate limiting for payment endpoints (10 requests/minute)
   - IP whitelisting capability
   - Security headers enforcement
   - HTTPS enforcement in production
   - Request validation and audit logging

4. **Configuration Management**
   - PCI DSS security configuration file
   - Environment-specific security settings
   - Compliance monitoring controls

#### Frontend Security Enhancements

1. **Enhanced Input Validation**
   - Real-time card number formatting
   - Luhn algorithm validation
   - CVV input restrictions (digits only, max 4 characters)
   - Cardholder name sanitization

2. **User Experience Improvements**
   - Card number formatting with spaces
   - Input length limitations
   - Suspicious pattern detection

### Security Controls Summary

| Control | Implementation | Status |
|---------|---------------|--------|
| Input Validation | Enhanced validation with Luhn algorithm | ✅ Implemented |
| Secure Logging | Masked sensitive data in logs | ✅ Implemented |
| Rate Limiting | 10 requests/minute for payment endpoints | ✅ Implemented |
| Security Headers | HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options, etc. | ✅ Implemented |
| HTTPS Enforcement | Required in production | ✅ Implemented |
| IP Whitelisting | Configurable whitelist | ✅ Implemented |
| Audit Logging | Payment operation audit trail | ✅ Implemented |

## PCI DSS Compliance Strategy

### Current Approach: SAQ D Compliance

Given that Nestery must handle raw card data, the following controls are required:

#### Technical Controls

1. **Network Security**
   - ✅ HTTPS/TLS 1.2+ for all communications
   - ✅ Security headers implementation
   - ⚠️ Network segmentation (requires infrastructure changes)
   - ⚠️ Firewall configuration (requires infrastructure changes)

2. **Data Protection**
   - ✅ No storage of card data post-transaction
   - ✅ Secure transmission to Booking.com
   - ✅ Input validation and sanitization
   - ⚠️ Encryption at rest (if temporary storage needed)

3. **Access Control**
   - ✅ Rate limiting
   - ✅ IP whitelisting capability
   - ⚠️ Multi-factor authentication (requires implementation)
   - ⚠️ Role-based access control (requires implementation)

4. **Monitoring**
   - ✅ Security event logging
   - ✅ Payment audit trail
   - ⚠️ Real-time monitoring (requires implementation)
   - ⚠️ Intrusion detection (requires implementation)

#### Operational Controls

1. **Policies and Procedures**
   - ⚠️ Information security policy (requires creation)
   - ⚠️ Incident response plan (requires creation)
   - ⚠️ Employee training program (requires implementation)

2. **Vulnerability Management**
   - ⚠️ Quarterly vulnerability scans (requires setup)
   - ⚠️ Annual penetration testing (requires scheduling)
   - ⚠️ Patch management process (requires implementation)

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Within 1 Week)

1. **Deploy Security Enhancements**
   - ✅ Backend security controls implemented
   - ✅ Frontend input validation enhanced
   - ✅ PCI security middleware deployed

2. **Configuration Updates**
   - Configure PCI security settings for production
   - Enable security monitoring and alerting
   - Set up audit log retention

### Short-term Actions (Within 1 Month)

1. **Infrastructure Security**
   - Implement network segmentation
   - Configure WAF (Web Application Firewall)
   - Set up vulnerability scanning

2. **Compliance Documentation**
   - Create information security policy
   - Develop incident response plan
   - Document security procedures

### Long-term Actions (Within 3 Months)

1. **Full PCI DSS Compliance**
   - Engage Qualified Security Assessor (QSA)
   - Complete SAQ D assessment
   - Implement remaining technical controls

2. **Continuous Monitoring**
   - Set up real-time security monitoring
   - Implement intrusion detection
   - Establish compliance monitoring

## Risk Assessment

### High-Risk Areas

1. **Card Data in Memory**: Temporary storage of card data during API calls
2. **Network Security**: Potential for man-in-the-middle attacks
3. **Application Security**: Injection attacks and data validation

### Mitigation Strategies

1. **Minimize Data Retention**: Clear card data from memory immediately after use
2. **Enhanced Monitoring**: Real-time detection of suspicious activities
3. **Regular Security Testing**: Quarterly vulnerability assessments

## Compliance Timeline

| Phase | Timeline | Deliverables |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| Phase 1 | Week 1 | Security controls implementation |
| Phase 2 | Month 1 | Infrastructure hardening |
| Phase 3 | Month 2 | Policy and procedure development |
| Phase 4 | Month 3 | QSA assessment and certification |

## Conclusion

The implemented security controls significantly improve Nestery's security posture for handling Booking.com payments. While full PCI DSS compliance requires additional infrastructure and operational changes, the current implementation provides a strong foundation for secure payment processing.

**Key Success Factors:**
- Enhanced input validation and sanitization
- Secure logging and audit trails
- Rate limiting and access controls
- HTTPS enforcement and security headers

**Next Steps:**
1. Deploy security enhancements to production
2. Configure monitoring and alerting
3. Begin infrastructure hardening
4. Engage QSA for compliance assessment

This approach ensures Nestery can securely process Booking.com payments while working toward full PCI DSS compliance.
