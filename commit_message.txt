feat(flutter): implement user-facing affiliate offers browser

Implements the user-facing Affiliate Offer Browser screen as per FRS 1.2, providing the frontend foundation for users to discover partner offers. This corresponds to TaskMaster Task ID 3.

This commit introduces the full UI and placeholder state management for the "Discover" section of the application.

Key implementations include:
- **New Feature Module:** Created the `affiliate_offers_browser` feature module following Clean Architecture principles.
- **UI Components:** Developed a reusable `OfferCardWidget` and `OfferFilterWidgets` for search and category filtering.
- **State Management:** Implemented Riverpod providers (`FutureProvider`, `StateNotifierProvider`) to manage mock data, filter state, and derived filtered offer lists.
- **Models:** Added `freezed` models for `OfferCardViewModel` and `OfferFilterState`.
- **Navigation:** Integrated a new "Discover" tab into the main bottom navigation bar via `go_router`, updating all relevant indices.
- **UX States:** Added robust handling for loading (shimmer), empty, and error states on the browser screen.

Fixes:
- **AdMob Crash:** Resolved an application startup crash by replacing the placeholder AdMob App ID in `AndroidManifest.xml` with a valid sample ID, allowing the app to run.
