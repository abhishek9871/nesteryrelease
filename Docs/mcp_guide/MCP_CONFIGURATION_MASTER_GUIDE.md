### üéØ PURPOSE
This file provides step-by-step instructions for configuring three essential MCP servers with Augment Code on any Windows system. When provided as context to an AI assistant, it enables perfect MCP setup and usage.

### üìã PREREQUISITES CHECK & INSTALLATION SEQUENCE

#### STEP 1: System Requirements Verification
**AI TASK**: Check if the following are installed, install if missing:

1. **Node.js (v18+)**
   - Check: `node --version` and `npm --version`
   - Install: Download from nodejs.org if missing
   - Verify: Both commands should return version numbers

2. **Git**
   - Check: `git --version`
   - Install: Download from git-scm.com if missing
   - Verify: Should return Git version

3. **Python (v3.11+)**

# Get current user path
echo $env:USERPROFILE

# Get current project path
Get-Location
```

#### STEP 6: Create Augment Code Settings Configuration
**AI TASK**: Create the following settings.json configuration using the paths from Step 5:

```json
{
    "workbench.editor.empty.hint": "hidden",
    "github.copilot.enable": {
        "*": false
    },
    "augment.chat.userGuidelines": "**Always use commands for windows powershell when working in the terminal for any command**\n\n**Use web search for package information mentioned in a task and make sure they are compatible with our project. Use Tavily MCP as of June 2, 2025 to be absolutely sure about everything. There must be no build failure on things like these after your comprehensive web research about the task that you are given in any chat thread. You will use comprehensive web searches for absolute surety on things you are not 100% confident about. Do not depend on you AI training data for doing things. Always find things using tavily MCP server that are as of 3rd June, 2025 and also things which will be perefct from a future perspective. You can use context 7 mcp as well in synchronisation with the web searches and then cross verify that information before implementing to be 1000% sure.**",
